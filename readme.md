### supercollider setup:

see: startup.sc for the main startup script. my supercollider startup file just looks like this:

```
"/absolute/path/to/repo/startup/startup.sc".loadRelative;
```

running some files will require samples. create a `samples` folder in the root. got samples from these spots:
- https://slab.org/tmp/samples-extra.zip
